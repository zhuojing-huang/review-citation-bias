tS0GnXilHq,"This paper explores diverse techniques for approximating two-layer neural networks (NNs). To begin with, the authors introduce a comprehensive framework that unifies the Top-K activation function, Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), and product-key memories (PKMs). By thoroughly analyzing their approach, they subsequently present enhancements for both MoEs and PKMs. The empirical investigations reveal that the proposed MoEs perform competitively when compared to the dense Transformer-XL, underscoring the applicability of MoEs to language models of varying scales.","1. The exploration of approximating two-layer feedforward networks (FFNs) is both novel and captivating. Notably, the authors provide a comprehensive perspective that encompasses various methods, and they also conduct a comprehensive comparison of the most notable MoE variants.
2. The motivation behind the paper is distinctly articulated and substantiated. The seamless progression from motivation to theoretical analysis, and ultimately to the proposal of the method, is presented in a coherent and natural manner.
3. The proposed approach is effectively supported by empirical experiments, demonstrating its ability to attain performance on par with dense networks.","1. The proposed $\sigma$-MoE framework requires further justification. The specific design approach for $W_3$ and the uniform initialization of weight matrices are notable contributions. The paper should delve into the rationale behind these design choices and their benefits, particularly in terms of their impact on the performance of the MoE model.

2. The empirical investigations provided appear somewhat limited in scope. Given that all experiments are exclusively conducted on WikiText-103 and Enwik8, which share similar data distributions, it would be prudent to expand the experimental scope to include other datasets. This would provide additional support for the performance claims of the $\sigma$-MoE model.

3. While the paper introduces novel elements through the MoE variant design, the novelty level might be constrained. To enhance the clarity of the novelty introduced beyond the MoE variant design, it's advisable to provide further elaboration and illustration.

","1. It would be valuable to include additional experiments on diverse text datasets such as PTB and C4. Expanding the experimental evaluation beyond Enwik8 and WikiText-103 can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach's performance across various text domains and scales.
2. Could you provide further clarification and elaboration on the design principles underlying the $\sigma$-MoE model?

LzJ6Vg1zuU,The paper presents a technique for zero-shot intent classification. The authors make use of a BERT model finetuned on the NLI task and a dependency parser to discover new intents not seen before.,"Creativity: The authors present a creative pipeline that combines several components to predict new intents in a zero-shot setting.

Experiments: For many experiments, the authors show results for several different methods, comparing to a variety of LLMs.","Simplistic approach: The method presented in Algorithm 1 just extracts words from the sentence. If the intent word is not explicitly expressed in the sentence, this method will be incapable of generating the correct intent.

Lack of baseline in Table 4: The authors only present various settings for their model. I'm not familiar with this research area, so I have no idea if there are approaches in previously published work that outperform this method that the authors have left out.

Marginal improvement in Table 4: The difference in results for each approach are very small, so the benefit of the proposed method does not seem large.

Interpretability of remaining results: It's hard to compare the performance to the LLMs because they only use cosine distance. It's clear the model outperforms in semantic similarity (according to the semantic encoder models used), but for more trustworthy results, a small sample of human evaluations should be used as well to be sure that this method outperforms the LLMs in the zero-shot setting. Another option would be to modify the LLM experiment such that label F1 scores could be produced (use a verbalizer to map LLM output to intent classes).","1. What is the frequency of examples in the dataset where the intent is explicitly mentioned in the sentence? If this is almost all of the cases, then my first reason to reject is not important. If there are a lot of examples without the intent mentioned, this method is fundamentally limited compared to LLMs which can generalize better than this approach (generate an intent without the intent being mentioned explicitly).

2. Are there any baselines that you could compare to for zero-shot intent classification? If so, why didn't you include them in Table 4?

What is the test set for Table 4?","2: Borderline: Some of the main claims/arguments are not sufficiently supported, there are major technical/methodological problems","2: Mediocre: This paper makes marginal contributions (vs non-contemporaneous work), so I would rather not see it in the conference.",3: Could reproduce the results with some difficulty.

Specifically, they mention:

* Human evaluations should be used alongside semantic similarity metrics to ensure the proposed method outperforms LLMs (which implies referencing existing work on human evaluation methods in NLP)
* Label F1 scores could be produced by using a verbalizer to map LLM output to intent classes (which suggests referencing literature on verbalization techniques and their applications)

However, the peer review does not specifically mention referring to any new or additional literature that was not already discussed in the original paper. The reviewer's suggestions are more focused on addressing methodological issues and improving the presentation of results.

If I had to infer, I would say that the author might suggest referencing existing work on zero-shot intent classification, NLI tasks, or dependency parsing, but this is not explicitly stated."
4WJ8SxwMk5,"This work focuses on the task of detecting partisan vs counter-partisan events in news reporting. The authors aggregate 103 news stories, each with 2 news articles from opposing ideologies, end extract events from them using a RoBERTa-based model. They then annotate (a) each article as ideologically leaning towards left/right and on a Likert scale (1-5, left-right) and (b) each identified event in a news article as partisan/counter-partisan/neutral. After a qualitative analysis of their annotations, they test two RoBERTa-based models on two tasks: (A) article-level ideology prediction and (B) partisan event detection -- for (B) they also try ChatGPT. 

The paper is well-written, albeit with a few clarification points needed primarily on the annotation process (§3). The major contribution is the introduction of a novel dataset, which can be useful for future research in this area. My major concern though is the lack of error and qualitative analysis of the results, which is quite important for this type of work: which are the most challenging cases for the best-performing model? Which cases are more easily captured? Is there a correlation between qualitative characteristics (e.g., sentiment) and the accuracy of the models?

mb7JHUgvGM,This paper introduces a method called 'Holistic Inter-Annotator Agreement' to compute the (percentage) agreement between each pair of annotators on the semantically most similar sentences they have both annotated. This allows the authors to compute what annotators are most similar to a particular annotator. This ranking is shown to correlate well with the ranking obtained using standard IAA metrics such as Cohen's K. ,"1. The paper is clearly built on a great deal of expertise about annotation, in particular in large-scale annotation projects. It raises some very good questions about the limitations of coefficients of agreement in such large-scale annotation projects, and illustrates some very good annotation practices - it could be useful to others aiming to run such a project.

2. The method itself makes a lot of sense.

3. the results obtained with the proposed method are analysed to a great depth.","1. The main problem I have with this paper is that it's not completely clear to me what is the problem that the authors are trying to solve. My understanding is that they are trying to come up with a more useful way of measuring the actual agreement between annotators not just on the few examples they both annotate, but I am not completely sure this is right. 

2. A more general problem is that others have realized that coefficients of agreement are really a limited metric - especially in case of subjective judgments - and have tried to devise more informative approaches, although nobody as far as I know has addressed the specific issue tackled in this paper. I am especially thinking of the work on probabilistic models of annotation by Passonneau and Carpenter, and their TACL 2014 paper. In that paper, the authors argue convincingly that a single number cannot be sufficient  for the in-depth  analysis of annotation that the authors of this paper have in mind. The type of analysis they propose involve building models of each annotator, and of each item, that do allow for more insightful comparisons. I would encourage the authors to have a look at these methods and perhaps think about generalizing them. ","1. Do I understand your objective correctly? Is your objective in effect to compute agreement between annotators on a larger scale, i.e., not only on the sentences they all annotate?

The authors adapt the SNIPS and ATIS, two classical slot-filing datasets to fulfill this setting. They proposed to combine contrastive learning and noise-induced adversarial learning for novel type prediction and propose a Query Enhanced Knowledge Distillation to alleviate the catastrophe-forgetting problem during incremental learning.  Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework when compared with a novel-type prediction baseline and two continual learning baselines. ","1. Propose a research problem that is more relevant to the realistic setting, i.e., incremental slot detection (both out-of-distribution and in-distribution), which requires continually detecting new slot values and deploying the new slot prediction models. This could be an interesting research topic for online dialog system development.

2. For slot detection, the paper utilizes learnable query vectors for feature matching and sequence prediction and use Hungarian algorithm to optimize the labeled triples. the same query can also be used to retrieve some representative data from the training set for incremental learning to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. Knowledge distillation is also used for fast model adaptation. This framework could potentially be useful and efficient in real dialog systems.","1. Lacking strong baselines. The incremental learning for dialog systems is a classical topic, many different approaches, like architecture-based, memory-based, and data-retrieval-based are proposed in previous work[1], and also compared with strong multi-task learning baseline.  Since this paper focuses on incremental learning, it needs more comparison with different baselines.

2. Lacking more complex benchmarks to verify the effectiveness of the method. Current benchmarks are small and toylike. More realistic dialog datasets like MultiWOZ, SGD, and dataset on DialogStudio should be considered.  In addition, ChatGPT or GPT-4 results on this benchmark should be included for more comparison. This may not be required, but it's crucial to demonstrate how hard and challenging the new task is.

xg3MAC1hDT,"This paper introduces PHD, a pixel-based language model for analyzing historical documents without using OCR. The main contributions are:

1. Proposes a novel method to generate synthetic scans that resemble historical documents for pretraining. This helps address the scarcity of large historical scan datasets.

2. Pretrains PHD on a combination of synthetic scans and real historical newspapers from the 18th-19th centuries.

3. Evaluates PHD on image reconstruction, clustering, language understanding tasks like GLUE, and question answering on both SQuAD and a real historical QA dataset.

4. Provides evidence that PHD can effectively understand language and has potential for assisting with NLP tasks involving historical documents.

5. Releases the datasets, models, and code to facilitate future research.

Overall, this paper explores using recent advances in pixel-based language modeling to process historical scans directly at the pixel level. This allows bypassing the OCR stage which can introduce noise when applied to historical documents. The proposed pretraining methodology and evaluations demonstrate the promise of this approach for historical document analysis.","This paper explores an interesting new direction and provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed techniques. Releasing the datasets and models could catalyze more work in this area.

2. Novel application of pixel-based language models to historical document analysis, bypassing the need for OCR. This is an interesting new direction for processing historical texts.
3. Releases new datasets, models, and code to facilitate research in this area. The historical QA dataset created from real newspaper ads could be valuable for the community.","1. Most of the pretraining data is modern text, not historical. More diverse historical data could help the model better adapt to that domain. Previous work, such as Donut, DiT, Dessurt, and LayoutLM (v1, v2, v3), pre-trained their models on IIT-CDIP. IIT-CDIP is a large-scale scanned document corpus used for pre-training language models.

2. The evaluation tasks, apart from one historical QA dataset, predominantly involve modern text. More historical evaluation data could better assess performance.

smD28y6BcO,"This work evaluates models' logical reasoning in the MCQ setting by probing it with additional questions about the reasoning behind selecting or eliminating individual choices. To this end, the authors build a new dataset, RULE. They start with questions from the ReClor dataset and annotate rationales for selecting and eliminating each of its answer choices. They then generate questions like for each choice which has one of the generated rationales as the answer.

These additional (sub-)questions have 2 key features:

1. They are in the same MCQ format as the original question. So one can probe the models' reasoning on the original question by these additional questions.
2. They are contrastive (minimally different), i.e., all subquestions share the same passage and answer choices, but they have different answers depending on the subquestion. This feature prevents models from taking simple shortcuts.

The authors have ensured the annotations are of high quality by human validation, and have also established a very high human score on the task.

Finally, the authors benchmark a large number of recent (few-shot, fine-tuned, with/without CoT) models on ReClor and RULE and demonstrate that all the models struggle and are behind humans. In particular, they find that models are extremely bad at selecting why a given choice is incorrect.

Finally, they explore (i) model-generated rationales and find humans are better at this task. (ii) using human-written rationales to improve models and find that selective subquestions help, eliminative ones hurt.","- This is a very well-done study and evaluation design. I particularly liked the two features highlighted in the summary above.

ttwwsOhAIT,"This paper introduces the Induction-Augmented Generation framework, which integrates inductive knowledge statements for Open-Domain QA tasks to enhance implicit reasoning. The framework proposes two models: IAG-GPT and IAG-student. IAG-GPT generates inductive knowledge statements using GPT-3 and utilizes both generated knowledge prompts and retrieved documents for QA tasks. Since IAG-GPT is dependent on the GPT-3 API, IAG-student is trained to distill GPT-3.",The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating inductive knowledge into the prompt on the CSQA and Strategy QA datasets. The presentation of quality examples (such as Table 6 and 7) further supports the validity of the work.,"* The consistency in reporting the results needs to be done. Figure 3-4 and Table 2-4 uses StrategyQA dev which makes it hard to compare with Table 1 StrategyQA test baselines.  
* Table 2 shows that knowledge statements generated with inductive prompting support QA performance. However, to fully verify the effectiveness of inductive knowledge statements, additional comparisons need to be made on CSQA dev with 15 retrieved documents versus CSQA dev with 10 retrieved documents and 5 inductive knowledge statements. On StrategyQA, a comparison between 10 retrieved documents and 5 retrieved documents with 5 inductive knowledge statements needs to be conducted.","* Is the concatenation style of Retrieval Only in IAG the same as FiD [1]? If it is FiD-style, then there will be N number of passages to encode with the query. If not, as shown in concept figure 2, there will be a single long input which is a concatenation of the query and all N passages for IAG-GPT and IAG-student. It needs more clarification because in the knowledge fusion experiment, it seems like all of the question, knowledge statements, and retrieved documents are concatenated into a single long input.
* On the CSQA dev dataset, it is stated that top-5 snippets are used (Line 423). However, in Line 465, on CSQA, it uses 10 retrieved documents. Is the top-5 snippets transformed into 10 retrieved documents? Or does it use top-10 snippets?
* Inductive prompting generates implicit knowledge through in-context learning of 5 demonstrations. How are trivial and CoT prompting done? The examples are shown in Table 7, but it is not clear how the prompts are formed.

n1Zz9dJ9U6,"Positional encoding is important in Transformer architecture, and until a few years ago, learnable absolute position embedding (APE) was often used (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2).

Clark+'19 reported that some attention heads in BERT attend to context words according to their relative positions; Ravishankar&Søgaard+'21 reported that some columns of absolute position embeddings are periodic; Chang+'22 reported that the position information is encoded in a hidden representation while remaining periodic.
However, it is not clear how periodicity is used in models, which is what this paper attacks.

Specifically, this paper showed that several attention heads in RoBERTa realize an attention pattern that depends on relative position by extracting the periodic components derived from APE from the hidden representation with shifting the phase in query and key transformation.","- Analyses use convincing and solid mathematical tools.
- Mechanism for realizing relative position-dependent attention patterns from absolute position embedding is really interesting.","- Limited Experiments
  - Most of the experiments (excluding Section 4.1.1) are limited to RoBERTa-base only, and it is unclear if the results can be generalized to other models adopting learnable APEs. It is important to investigate whether the results can be generalized to differences in model size, objective function, and architecture (i.e., encoder, encoder-decoder, or decoder). In particular, it is worthwhile to include more analysis and discussion for GPT-2. For example, I would like to see the results of Figure 2 for GPT-2.
  - The input for the analysis is limited to only 100 or 200 samples from wikitext-2. It would be desirable to experiment with a larger number of samples or with datasets from various domains.
- Findings are interesting, but no statement of what the contribution is and how practical impact on the community or practical use. (Question A).
- Results contradicting those reported in existing studies (Clark+'19) are observed but not discussed (Question B).
- I do not really agree with the argument in Section 5 that word embedding contributes to relative position-dependent attention patterns. The target head is in layer 8, and the changes caused by large deviations from the input, such as only position embedding, are quite large at layer 8. It is likely that the behavior is not such that it can be discussed to explain the behavior under normal conditions. Word embeddings may be the only prerequisites for the model to work properly rather than playing an important role in certain attention patterns.
- Introduction says to analyze ""why attention depends on relative position,"" but I cannot find content that adequately answers this question.
- There is no connection or discussion of relative position embedding, which is typically employed in recent Transformer models in place of learnable APE (Question C).","- A. What is the substantial contribution to the community from these findings? For example, could they lead to any ideas to improve the Transformer architecture?
- B. Clark+'19 reported that most heads pay little attention to themselves and that there are heads that focus heavily on adjacent tokens, especially in the earlier layers. However, this paper shows that there are several heads that focus on themselves and that heads focusing heavily on adjacent token heads were found in various layers. What is the reason for this discrepancy?
- C. Nowadays, relative position embedding is often used instead of APE. Can this paper provide insights into the reasons for the superiority of relative position embedding?

LKMFvBsLIp,"The authors propose an induction-augmented framework that utilizes inductive knowledge derived from LLMs and the retrieved documents for better implicit reasoning. Specifically, they enhance the conventional RAG with an inductor that generates inductive knowledge.

The authors propose an IAG-GPT model which directly utilizes GPT-3 and IAG-Student which is first trained via knowledge distillation with GPT-3 pseudo labels, and then optimized through a differentiable beam search algorithm.

The experiments show that IAG-GPT has significant advantages over ChatGPT and performs extremely well on CSQA2.0 and StrategyQA. IAG-Student outperforms RAG baselines.
","This paper addresses a non-trivial problem for implicit reasoning by introducing an inductor with the assistance of LLMs.  

The authors conduct extensive experiments and the experiment results are reasonable.

","1. The generalization ability of the model is a major concern. 
- The model assigns inductive information to every question, even when some questions do not require it. A potential solution could be implementing a question classifier to identify the type of question and determine whether inductive information is necessary for a particular query.
- The strict structure/formulation of the prompt, especially the Knowledge part, is another issue (lines 245-247). 

2. Another minor issue is that there is a huge gap between the performance of IAG-GPT and IAG-Student, which makes the distilled model and its corresponding algorithm less convincing. More experiments on larger models are expected.

7XKdnhSQ5p,"The paper “Chinese Lexical Substitution: Dataset and Method” presents a novel approach for the creation of annotated Lexical Substitution datasets, focusing on the Chinese language to address the lack of an existing Chinese data source for LS. In addition, the authors propose a new ensemble method, combining four classes of LS methods. In doing so, the authors evaluate both the dataset they have created, as well as the effectiveness of their ensemble approach.","The contributions presented by the authors in this paper are many.

Firstly, the authors highlights shortcomings of existing LS datasets, particularly pointing to their relatively small scale and lack of coverage. While this has been pointed out in the literature before (e.g., SwordS), the authors justify that the issues still persist. Moreover, the lack of LS resources for the Chinese language is highlighted.

The new annotation scheme presented is highly original. Motivated by the issue of small-scale datasets, the authors propose a method that allows for larger-scale corpus creation via the automation of existing methods. The quality of these outputs is ensured by the placement of human-made decisions at the end of the pipeline. The creation and execution of this process is well-described and transparent.

The introduction of the CHNLS dataset is likewise a great contribution. This is supplemented by descriptive statistics of the dataset, as well as a discussion of the evaluation that was run to measure the quality and coverage.

The experiments run using the novel ensemble method are demonstrated by using well-known LS metrics from LS07, as well as the presentation of illustrative examples.

The paper is concluded by a meaningful discussion of the results, particularly in comparison to existing datasets and methods.
","Besides the occasional grammatical or stylistic errors (some highlighted below), there are only a few points of weakness exhibited by the paper.

For example, the details of the ensemble method are a bit lacking. The exact construction of the ensemble, as well as the scheme used to weigh the individual methods’ scores, is not fully elucidated.

In addition, the proposed ensemble is only evaluated on the newly created dataset, making it hard to compare against other existing methods, such as those that have been evaluated on English data.

y5Ecijt5fr,"This paper presents Adapter-TST, a straightforward yet effective and light-weight method for addressing the challenging task of multiple-attribute textual style transfer (TST). In contrast to single-attribute TST, which focuses on changing one stylistic property at a time, Adapter-TST deals with simultaneously altering multiple stylistic properties—such as sentiment, tense, voice, formality, and politeness. The Adapter-TST approach involves inserting simple neural adapters (consisting a feed-forward down-project layer, followed by a nonlinear activation function, followed by a feed forward up-project layer, along with a skip-connection layer between two projection layers) into a pre-trained network, like a pre-trained BART model, to capture and change diverse attribute information. The weights (parameters) of the original network are kept frozen during training, and only the additional adapter layers are trained. Adapter-TST offers two configurations, ""parallel"" and ""stack,"" enabling models to perform compositional style transformation (text editing).

In order to validate the effectiveness of Adapter-TST, the authors employ BART-Large as their backbone model and conduct experiments on the Yelp and StylePTB datasets. Their results indicate that Adapter-TST often performs on par with, not outperforms, several baseline methods, including BackTrans, CrossAlign, DualRL, and StyleTransformer, along certain evaluation metrics. Although human evaluation shows positive outcomes for Adapter-TST, the improvements do not appear to be statistically significant.","* Textual style transfer with multiple attributes remains a relatively unexplored and challenging task within the field of NLP. This paper focuses on this intriguing problem and introduces an intuitive, effective, and light-weight approach to tackle it. 
* The paper demonstrates a clear motivation for studying the problem of multiple-attribute textual style transfer and effectively outlines their research objectives. Moreover, the contributions of their work are well-defined, and the paper is written in a coherent manner overall, making it easy to understand both the arguments and results presented.
* This work has the potential to be of interest to not only the TST community but also the broader NLG community, as it proposes a parameter-efficient method for compositional text editing. (That said, the paper lacks clarity regarding the amount of fine-tuning data required to achieve satisfactory task performance and the overall generalizability of the proposed Adapter-TST approach. Further investigation on these aspects would be rather beneficial to better understand the practical implications of this method.)
* On the whole, the experimental setup seems to be sound and thorough.","* While this limitation is not a significant reason for rejection, I believe that the authors could enhance the credibility of their proposed approach by demonstrating its generalizability and robustness. Currently, the focus is solely on one true multi-attribute TST dataset (StylePTB) and one simple model type (BART-Large). The inclusion of an additional dataset would strengthen their claims and offer a clearer demonstration of Adapter-TST’s efficacy. Moreover, a more comprehensive analysis of their findings is needed in my opinion, as the paper, in its current form, offers only a surface-level discussion of the results.
* This is a relatively minor concern, but I fear that the paper does not sufficiently make reference to the recent studies on textual style transfer and consider stronger baselines for the Yelp dataset.
* In my opinion, the authors missed an opportunity to include two other simple yet potentially strong baselines in their evaluation: an Alpaca (or LLaMa) model with and without adapters. Considering these instruction-tuned models could have provided valuable insights even under a zero-shot setting. Comparing their proposed approach against such baselines could have further enriched the analysis and strengthened the overall study.","* Question A. Could you please provide more details about the training of the adapter layers? For instance, how many epochs did you train your models? How important is the classification loss? 
* Question B. How crucial are the parallel connections? Do you think that stack connections might be enough to perform compositional text editing?

LTvE66R8hh,"The paper introduces an adapter-based approach for the multiple-attribute text style transfer task.  In short, the processed method Adapter-TST utilizes a series of adapters to model different types of attribute information. As a parameter-efficient method, Adapter-TST achieves better performance with a very low number of training parameters compared to the previous method.","1. The paper was well-written and easy to follow.
2. How to use parametric efficient methods in style transfer tasks is an important field worth exploring.","1. The contribution of the whole paper is limited.  Using adapter-based PLMs is a common strategy for text generation tasks, even those involving multi-attribute-based generation tasks, such as [2][3]. At the same time, the adapter used in this paper is not significantly different from the previous common methods, nor is it optimized for tasks.
2. This paper designed the method only with BART as the backbone. For this reason, I think it might be difficult to call this particular approach a ""parameter-efficient framework"" because its generality has yet to be proven.
3. There are serious deficiencies and possible unfair comparisons in the experimental part. The main reasons are as follows:
3.1 Baselines selected in the experiment are seriously missing. The experiment only compares the proposed method with the non-parameter-efficient method Styletransformer, while other parameter-efficient methods are ignored, especially prompt-learning-based methods, such as[1][2][3]. Although these methods are not applied to style transfer, it is clear that they are general-purpose and can be easily migrated to this task, and [2][3] also perform a similar multi-attribute text generation task while using adapter-based PLMs as baselines.
3.2 Unfair comparison with baselines.  The backbone of Adapter-TST is BART-Large while the backbone of the baseline is Transformer,  it is difficult to determine whether the performance gains are due to the use of PLMs or the proposed approach.

VpCXP2olFf,"This paper presents a new method to improve cross-lingual transfer based on source-side word reordering (operated at the level of dependency subtrees). The authors do so by estimating word order preferences from data, then casting them as constraints to an SMT solver to identify the optimal reordering. The method is experimented on 3 tasks and on typologically diverse languages. Results are ambivalent (usually beneficial but detrimental for some language pairs) but the authors propose a mitigation measure (concatenating original and reordered data) that is successful. Experiments are extended to the few-shot scenario and to comparison among architectures, which yields new insights on the generalizability of the method as well as on properties of existing algorithms.","[Ac-A] The proposed method is thought-enriching and opens new research avenues.

[Ac-B] The authors experiment with a large variety of languages (typologically diverse), tasks, settings (zero-shot, few-shot, different architectures, etc.), which yields more comprehensive and generalizable results.

[Ac-C] Much appreciated the initiative to include a longer discussion on the method's shortcomings in the annex (beyond the ""Limitations"" paragraph).

[Ac-D] Annexes provide comprehensive experimental details and results, including standard deviations, which is very good methodology.","**[Re-A]** The idea underlying this contribution is quite interesting (using a SMT solver to improve upon prior similar work), but it also seems that the authors missed an important related work (Aufrant et al. 2016, see Missing references), and that if accounting for it they would possibly have made some choices differently, and interpreted some of their results differently.

In particular, Equation (2) shows that they discretize the statistics measured empirically (turning a slight preference into a deterministic hard constraint). Why? Aufrant et al. (2016) have precisely discussed (and implemented accordingly) how it is beneficial to have ""*smooth transformations (with mean preference rate objectives and error margins)*"", in other words to avoid deterministic word order, because it is a linguistic fact that for some languages the word order preference is not necessarily deterministic for a given label pair. And they also show how deterministic reordering can be detrimental in practice, by losing useful (balanced) information in the source treebank.

Impact:
- [Re-A1] The argument made on line 331 (that ENSEMBLE works better because statistical estimation creates imperfection) appears dubious in light of that prior work. On the contrary: it is because the proposed method overlooks the statistical nature of word order preference, that ENSEMBLE works better. Indeed, when source has mostly prenominal adjectives and the target has a very slight preference for postnominal, then STANDARD contains 100% postnominal, whereas ENSEMBLE contains half prenominal / half postnominal (= much closer to the target)… which is exactly what Aufrant et al. advocated for. This sheds a completely new light on ENSEMBLE, and significantly changes the interpretation of the results.
- [Re-A2] Same for the case of performance decrease in case of close languages: a simple interpretation is that close languages have already similar word order ratios for a given label pair, and the discretized constraints move them further. This is exactly the ""French to Italian"" case analyzed by Aufrant et al. So these observations may just be an artefact of the choice to discretize the constraints, not an evidence of the applicability of reordering in general depending on the language pair.
- [Re-A3] And for the remark line 506 on MTOP results opposite to Multilingual-TOP ones: since language sets are different, that again may just be an artefact of the fact that target languages on one side or the other have more deterministic or more balanced word order preferences.

The authors acknowledge on line 1039 that there may be an issue with this discretization, but the analysis does not go as far as observing how that impacts (and possibly invalidates) some of their own conclusions and analyses in the paper. Actually, the mention of ""statistical validity"" (line 1041) looks as if the authors consider that either ""nmod < amod"" or ""amod < nmod"" is the appropriate constraint and when measuring P=0.51 it only prevents to identify which one is, NOT that the appropriate one would indeed be ""half of each"".

**[Re-B]** There is also an issue with the realism of the targeted scenarios. Often when working on low-resourced scenarios, there are irremediable issues that prevent from being fully realistic (e.g. evaluation can only be done when sufficient data exists, so not for actually low-resourced languages). So it is fully OK to assume that such work is done in best-effort mode. But this does not mean discarding the corresponding issues as being irrelevant, but rather to acknowledge them and acknowledge they are not solvable. Plus, care must be taken that the proposed methods would actually be meaningful in a real low-resourced scenario.

More precisely:
- [Re-B1] Regarding the pre-requisite for an UD treebank to estimate the POCs, line 359 accurately observes that UD is available for many languages anyway. However, treebank availability does not mean availability of a treebank with size comparable (hence the same reliability of POC estimation) to the large treebanks used in Table 5 for French, Spanish, or German. So this presumably overestimates a lot the quality of the POCs estimated in actually low-resourced settings. In particular, the treatment made of footnote 6 is questionable: precisely this is a real-world scenario of low-resourced language, so the conclusion ""impossible to extract"" raises major questions on the applicability of the method to actual low-resourced cases.
- [Re-B2] The scenario for estimating POCs without a treebank also does not seem very convincing. If using annotation projection to produce a treebank in the target language, why only using it for estimating POCs (and then training on a treebank from a different language), rather than directly using the projected trees as training treebank? And same for the other tasks, if there is parallel data to do annotation projection, then isn't it appropriate to project the available TOP & RC annotations through that parallel corpus, instead of resorting to a convoluted approach through another corpus and through data transforms? Or has this issue already been thought of, and were there specific reasons to prefer that approach?

**[Re-C]** Finally there is a number of places where the analysis is too shallow, or sometimes completely missing:
- [Re-C1] For the relation-classification task, lines 524-534 only describe results, without any comment on what can be concluded from those results.
- [Re-C2] The remark line 502 on English vs French overlooks that English and French are indeed related, but have nevertheless a number of important typological differences (pre/postnominal adjectives for instance), so it is unsurprising to observe gains. What is the concept of ""typologically distant"" used here?
- [Re-C3] Only English is used as source language, which is clearly not neutral when considering typology (English being rather atypical among the 7000 languages, regarding typology). Surely these experiments are computationally expensive, so experimenting with many sources was probably not doable. But the motivations and impact of that choice would have deserved at least a comment.
- [Re-C4] In Table 5, a number of s2s results are so low that it is hard to consider that the model does anything (or at least, it does not outperform a crude heuristic such as ""dependency to the left neighbour, with the majority-class as relation label""). This raises many questions on how to interpret the score increase, so this would have at least deserved a comment (more than just calling it ""subpar"").","[Question A] Lines 75-80, I don't understand the point made here. Isn't ""use pre-nominal adjectival modification"" the same as ""high probability for adjectival modifiers to precede the headword""? What difference did the authors want to make here?

[Question B] Line 280 states ""assuming that the target language does not have determiners"", but it is unclear how this information has been used in the given example (has it?). How is the absence of determiners accounted for in the method? (Side remark related to [Re-A] above: Aufrant et al. also considered the case of absent determiners)

[Question C] Line 300 mentions an approach to estimate POCs without a treebank, but it is not clear where in the paper this is experimented with. For which languages has this method been used, and in which Table are the corresponding results?

[Question D] In the §4.2.1 experiment, what has been done exactly for the Thai data? Because line 390 states ""never use the same dataset"", but both line 381 and Table 6 mention Thai-PUD. Which one is correct?

[Question E] Line 447 mentions the use of TAC English for train and Trans-TAC for test, but Trans-TAC is already a translation of TAC English, so there may be leaking. Is it the case that the Trans-TAC data used is solely translated from the **test** split of TAC English? Can you clarify and justify why this is sound evaluation?

[Question F] For the few-shot scenario (line 518 and Table 4), is the experiment conducted with the models based on XLM or mT5?

[Question G] Line 1025, how does it help mitigating conflicts to discard the irrelevant constraints? If those constraints are not applicable to that subtree (because root labels do not match), then they do not take part in the computation of the solver, right? So why would they be the ones preventing the solver from finding an ordering?",4: Strong: This study provides sufficient support for all of its claims/arguments. ,4: Strong: This paper deepens the understanding of some phenomenon or lowers the barriers to an existing research direction.,"4: Could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.",No,"4: Quite sure.

iNf3nsHt5m,"The paper presents an interesting approach to reordering for multilingual NLP, which instead of reordering the words of sentence, it reorders the sub-trees of its universal dependencies parse tree. The proposed method is shown to outperform previous approaches both in zero- and few-shots settings.","[1] The proposed method is simple, effective, and particularly suited to post-hoc interpretability.

[2] The paper considers both few-shot and zero-shot experiments.

[3] The ""Related work"" section is very informative and clear. Personally, I do not work on machine translation, and I really enjoyed quality of the overview. 

[4] Interestingly, the proposed method is associated with a higher performance gain in the seq2seq setting, highlighting a difficulty of encoder-decoder architectures in dealing with variable word order patterns.","[1] I think that the study could greatly benefit from an objective quantification of the typological / word-order distance between the languages considered. One of the point I found most interesting about this work is that there seems to be an increase in performance for languages that are distant from English (e.g., Japanese, Hindi), and a decrease in performance (sometimes) for languages that are close to English (e.g., Spanish, German, especially with mT5). It would be great to assess this trend more formally, with a metric of typological similarity (e.g., using WALS). 

[2] The authors state that their approach is suited for interpretability; however, the way POCs can be interpreted is never truly addressed in the body of the paper. It would have been a very nice follow-up analysis/appendix.","[1] l. 477 What about Irish? There seems to be an advantage of your method there.

[3] ll. 512-513 What do you mean by significant? Did you test it with some statistical test? One option could be the McNemar test on paired nominal data. It is true that the difference is numerically small, but statistical significance (p-values) depend on the variance of the samples. Very small differences can be statistically significant with large sample sizes.

This paper deals with a practical problem, namely the regular updates of the UMLS, which involve the integration of new terminological vocabularies. The papers proposes a methodology which could be used to speed up the updates, by automatically finding whether
a new term is a potential synonymous of a term already in the UMLS, or it can be attributed to a novel concept, not yet present in the UMLS.

The paper proposes a different conceptualization of the problem compared to previous approaches. Rather then simply evaluating the similarity of a new term to existing terms, the paper proposes an approach where each new term is assessed in relation to the entire
UMLS, and either a concept is found to which the term can be assigned, or the term is maked as novel, and a new concept will have
to be created. I am not completely convinced that this different conceptualization can be considered innovative, as it seems to me to
be entirely derivable from the original one.


","
Well developed study of the problem of UMLS update, which is framed as a problem similar but not identical to (biomedical) entity linking.
Well designed experimental setup, with one particular UMLS update used as a reference for training/development/testing, and other
updates used for further testing of the results. Interesting combination of rule-based and BERT-based methods. Good evaluation.
","
The problem tackled by the authors is extremely specific, and has a very narrow application, although the methods could probably be generalized to similar problems of knowledge base update.

The evaluation metrics are not sufficiently clearly described, but it might be just a question of providing a more formal definition.","
Please provide a more accurate description of the evaluation metrics in section 4.2.  I suggest to use formulas.

In particular the ""ranking accuracy"", which is a central metric in the paper because it is the one where the most
improvements are seen, is very superficially defined. It is not clear if it is a proper ranking metric, as the name
suggest, or a measure of accuracy. If it is a ranking metric, please explain in which sense it provides a measure
of the quality of the ranking. If it is not, please name it differently. 

I also struggled a bit to understand the definition of New Concept Precision"" because it is not immediately
obvious what is the different between ""correct new concept predictions"" and ""true new concept atoms"", but
I believe I understood it. 

In any case, formulas would help understanding and remove some ambiguity.

LIuV4fZqAO,"The paper's key contributions are as follows:

1. The paper proposes an inductive prompting method inspired by cognitive functions of inductive reasoning. This method guides language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3, to generate knowledge statements that establish reasoning paths. 

2.  The paper introduces the Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework, which enhances the traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. 

3. The paper presents two variants of the IAG framework. IAG-GPT leverages the inductive knowledge statements sampled from GPT-3 as evidence for the generator.","This paper offers several strengths and benefits:

1.The paper introduces a novel approach, Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG), which effectively combines inductive reasoning with language generation for answering implicit reasoning questions. 

2.  Implicit reasoning questions pose a significant challenge for open-domain question answering systems. By focusing on this challenge, the paper contributes to solving an important problem in the field of NLP, advancing the state of the art in understanding and generating reasoned answers.

3. The paper presents a well-defined framework (IAG) and a detailed methodology for integrating inductive knowledge into the answer generation process.","there are also some potential weaknesses:

1.  The proposed Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework involves multiple components, including retrieval, induction, and generation, which might make it challenging for researchers to reproduce and implement the approach. 

2.  The paper heavily relies on external language models, such as GPT-3, for generating inductive knowledge and improving performance. This reliance raises concerns about the availability, cost, and access to these models, which could limit the adoption of the proposed approach by researchers with limited resources or access.


3.  While the paper highlights successful cases where inductive knowledge enhances answer prediction, it does not thoroughly analyze or discuss cases where the approach might fail or provide incorrect answers.
